### Description
The Fertilizer Sales Report provides a comprehensive overview of fertilizer sales across the United States. It offers valuable insights into sales trends, product performance, and regional distribution, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies and improve business performance.

### Situation
The sales team faced challenges in tracking and analyzing fertilizer sales data across multiple regions. The unstructured data hindered the ability to:
- Monitor sales trends and identify growth opportunities.
- Analyze product performance and customer preferences.
- Optimize inventory management and distribution strategies.
- Make data-driven decisions to improve sales and marketing efforts.

### Task
As the data analyst for this project, my task was to consolidate and analyze fertilizer sales data across multiple regions. By creating an interactive Power BI dashboard, I aimed to:
- **Visualize sales trends and patterns**: Identify seasonal variations, growth trends, and potential sales opportunities.
- **Analyze product performance**: Determine the best-selling products and identify areas for product optimization.
- **Track sales by region**: Analyze regional performance and identify underperforming regions.
- **Support informed decision-making**: Provide actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, inventory management, and marketing efforts.

### Action

#### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Data Validation**: Checked for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, corrected errors, and handled missing data appropriately.
- **Data Transformation**: Reshaped and restructured the data to align with the desired analysis, including categorizing products and standardizing units of measurement.

#### Data Modeling
- **Data Structure**: Designed a star schema data model to organize data efficiently, with a fact table containing sales data and dimension tables for product category, region, time period, and customer information.

#### Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilized EDA techniques to understand data distribution, identify trends, and uncover potential insights.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzed sales trends over time to identify seasonal patterns, growth rates, and anomalies.
- **Product Performance Analysis**: Evaluated the sales performance of different product categories to identify best-sellers and underperforming products.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Analyzed sales performance by region to identify high-performing and low-performing areas.
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive visualizations, such as line charts, bar charts, and maps, to communicate insights effectively.
